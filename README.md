# Reactivity

A Bleeding Edge React Universal Boilerplate for Power Users.

Yes this is really another boilerplate because that whats missing in the react world right? Well actually yes... Why you ask? 

Well see we need a boilerplate for people who want to be able to tweak at every layer of the application if you are comfortable with installing something like [offline-plugin](https://github.com/NekR/offline-plugin) and letting that manage your offline settings then this is not the boilerplate for you, By no means are we saying that is an incorrect approach all were saying is that this boilerplate is targeted at a different audience.

## Features

You will find that this boilerplate covers all the expected areas such as SEO, Hot Reloading and all the other things typically covered in a boilerplate, check our to do list to see whats not there yet and whats coming. 

Whats unique about this boilerplate however is:

- Universal Rendering with Code Splitting.
- RXJS for action side effects.
- PWA Ready.
- No scaffolding tools.
- No Automated service worker generation, you get to write your own.
