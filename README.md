What is Reactivity? Well at its most basic definition it is how easily an atom has a chemical reaction with another element. Our goal is to achieve stable valence levels, A full valence shell if you will.

But really its just a Boilerplate.

Because that whats missing in the react realm right?

Well see we need a boilerplate for people who want to be able to tweak every atom of an application a simple boilerplate that doesn't contain any magic or code generation that takes pages of documentation to learn how to override, its a boilerplate for power users.
