What is Reactivity? Well at its most basic definition it is how easily an atom has a chemical reaction with another element. Our goal is to achieve stable valence levels, a full valence shell if you will.

But really it's just a boilerplate.

Because that's what's missing in the React realm right?

Well see we need a boilerplate for people who want to be able to tweak every atom of an application and a simple boilerplate that doesn't contain any magic or code generation that takes pages of documentation to learn how to override, it's a boilerplate for power users.

#### View our [Example App Here](https://reactivity.now.sh)

Deployed using [now](https://zeit.co/now) like so `now --public --dotenv=.env`

## Features

You will find that this boilerplate covers all the expected areas such as SEO, Hot Reloading and all the other things typically covered in a boilerplate, check out our pull requests to see what's coming up.

Whats unique about this boilerplate however is:

- Universal Rendering with Code Splitting - *(thanks to [react-universal-component](https://github.com/faceyspacey/react-universal-component))*
- RXJS for action side effects. - *(thanks to [react-redux-epic](https://github.com/BerkeleyTrue/react-redux-epic))*
- PWA Ready.
- No scaffolding tools.
- No Automated service worker generation, you get to write your own. - *(thanks to [serviceworker-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/oliviertassinari/serviceworker-webpack-plugin))*

## Getting Started

If you haven't yet start by installing [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/).

1. Clone this repo using `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/madeagency/reactivity.git`
2. Move to the appropriate directory: `cd reactivity`.
3. Copy the `.sample.env` to `.env` and change any details as required.
4. Run `yarn install` in order to install dependencies.
5. Run `yarn dev` for development mode or `yarn prod` for production mode and you will see the app running at `http://localhost:[PORT_SPECIFIED_IN_.ENV]`.

*Note: you may want to set `ENABLE_SW` to `false` in the `.env` file to disable the service worker during development*

## Deployment

This will largely vary however heres a super simple overview.

1. Run `yarn build`
2. Run either `yarn start` or `node bin/server.prod.js` to start the application.

You could also run `start:prod` after step one to immediately launch the app after its been built.
